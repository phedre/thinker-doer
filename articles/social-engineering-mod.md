The SE model proposed in article above is for vanilla. WTP uses a different one since it uses different rules and, therefore, SE effects are somewhat differrently weighted comparing to each other.. However, ideas about balancing and different effect comparison methods are still generally valid.

# Usage analysis

Simple comparison of available rating values and how often are they given in vanilla SE models.

Model use is a sum of absolute values used in SE choices.

_Vanilla_

| effect | values | use | use, % |
| ---- | ----: | ----: | ----: |
|	ECONOMY | 6 | 5 | 80 |
|	EFFIC | 9 | 11 | 120 |
|	SUPPORT | 8 | 7 | 88 |
|	MORALE | 9 | 9 | 100 |
|	POLICE | 9 | 12 | 130 |
|	GROWTH | 9 | 8 | 90 |

# Effect comparison

A subjective attempt to compare effects to each other. The comparison is on a very average level: accross multiple games and multiple game scenarios. Effect value and SE model value still vary greatly depending on circumstances. Such effect weights are only a baseline for SE table balance but other factors are at play as well.

Weights are for early, mid, and late game.

| effect | early | middle | late | comment |
| ---- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ---- |
|	INDUSTRY | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | Baseline effect for others to compare against. |
|	RESEARCH | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | Subjective estimate. |
|	ECONOMY | 1.50 | 1.25 | 1.00 | Globally averaged value by all rating transitions. |
|	EFFICIENCY | 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.50 | Value grows with empire size. |
|	SUPPORT | 1.50 | 1.00 | 0.50 |  |
|	MORALE | 0.50 | 0.25 | 0.00 |  |
|	POLICE | 1.00 | 0.75 | 0.50 |  |
|	GROWTH | 1.50 | 1.75 | 2.00 |  |
|	PLANET | 0.50 | 0.25 | 0.00 |  |
|	PROBE | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |  |
