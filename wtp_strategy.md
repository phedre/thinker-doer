# The Will to Power: Strategy tips for newcomers

This mod enhances *Alpha Centauri: Alien Crossfire* experience by improving AI and rebalancing other features. Therefore, it is more diffcult to beat and play style differs a little from vanilla. It is irrelevant to those never exposed to unmodded game but for those who mastered vanilla already it **is**.  
:wink:

# Think & Adapt

Really! This mod is so much more intense that you have to review your general strategy every 5-10 turns or so. Whether to attack or build a defense or expand to land or expand to sea or to strengthen infrastructure or to rush for new technologies. You won't be able to succeed in all diarections. Choose the one that suits your current situation best. Standard "Fusion Power + Needlejets = global conquest" strategy doesn't work anymore. You need to mix and match it with other macro and micro strategies.  
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Besides of general direction you'll be making decisions on lower level about many movements, attack, defenses, maneuvering, etc. Hopefully, the new battle winning probability display helps you in that.

# Natives

They are a threat. Minimize traveling through fungus. Invest a little bit more than usual in your scouting and base defense forces because you'll incur constant losses. Avoid isolated combat if possible. Instead converge multiple units on them from different locations even base defenders. It is better to eliminate them at all cost and then rebuild your defenders as needed.

Use base and terrain defense bonuses. You are better on psi defense in this mod. There are no planetpearls either. So it doesn't matter whether you win on attack or defense.

Stack bases with at least two defenders. It is still beneficial to build bare Scout Patrol for retaliation even after aquiring Hypnotic Trance.

PLANET positive factions can build up native army but not for free. You will be converting 1-2 units into 1 captured native with +1 PLANET (into 2 with +2 PLANET). Still it may be beneficial for preparing attack against faction which is ahead of you in conventional weaponry. Assess cost and benefits.

# Terraforming

Forest is expensive and weaker. Makes sense to plant sparingly to increase further spreading coverage. Use in arid areas mostly. Normally prefer combination of rainy farms + rocky mines.

Coastal bases with both land and sea formers are best self supported production centers. They have plenty food from sea and excess of minerals from land rocky mines.

# Early conflict

Same story here. Weight your costs and benefits. Attack only very close neighbor, only if you have fat chances of conquering their bases, and only for resource rich land. Don't fight for just territory. You'll lose more in development momentum.

# Expand in all directions

Land and sea equally. Land bases are quickstartes and give you immediate benefits. Sea bases have huge future potential from the other side. Unless you claim extremely fertile land (like jungle) you won't be able to overtake AI economically without heavy sea expansion.

Don't worry about claiming territory to occupy it later. Unlike vanilla here expansion is a work in itself requiring huge investments. Put your investments at work as quickly as possible. Build new bases more or less nearby and don't drag colonies across the map just to deny territory to opponent. AI develop so quickly that you won't possible be able to secure whole perimeter of your desired territory. Use what you have on hands and use it wisely.

# Protect borders

This is a cornerstone of this mod. Protecting borders does pay off! Start establishing defense in borderline bases as soon as your expansion reaches other faction territory. Prepare in full: build Perimeter Defense, build sensors, prototype good armor and artillery and build few defensive units in each border base and a little of artillery to dispatch between pressure points. It doesn't matter if your garrison units are slightly obsolete. Prototype new units as soon as you discover them but don't replace your old defenders immediatelly. With such infrastructure they will easily be able to hold off first wave until you forge reinforcement. Then you keep your ground with much less losses than aggressor. Eventually you outrun them economically and then you have a choice either to keep them at bay and continue economical development or counter invade their territory.

# Artillery

Overall slower repair rates lay our foundation for attrition war. Player is not limited to one turn assault to capture a base anymore. Fighting for 5-10 turns may be fruitful as well. Economy of war is to destroy more enemy HPs and lose less of your own. Bombardment let you do just that by taking away enemy HPs unpenalized. Economic wise artillery superiority doubles or triples your sheer army power.

# Army composition

Waves of mind worms is not a single tool anymore. Hypnotic Trance and Empath Song can be slapped on any unit for cheap 1-2 mineral rows making pure native assault quite ineffective without huge disparity in PLANET rating.

Use natives with hight PLANET rating or against faction with low PLANET rating (or both). Preceed worms wave with launchers bombardment. Artillery does make a difference.

For conventional warfare use a mix of artillery and heavy armored infantry on main attack direction. Use fast light armored units on main attack direction only if they can bypass bombardment range in one turn or enemy artillery tears your speeders in pieces before they strike. Otherwise, use them to harrass remote locations, destroy non combat units and infrastructure. Air units can be used for direct attack against opponent without AAA tracking and Airspace Complex. Against more prepared opponent they can be used to cut out reinforcement coming from inside of enemy territory.

Mixing conventional and native units usually doesn't work well as it is difficult to maximize both MORALE and PLANET ratings at the same time.

# Probe teams

You always got to have few of them at frontline whether you attack or defend. Period. No much change from vanilla here.

# Armored non combat units

Secondary statistics is cheap in this mod. You can slap full armor on non combat units for half price to protect your expansion and development during war time. Same is true for defensive abilities like Hypnotic Trance or AAA Tracking. They are cheap and with higher reactors such advanced units will be quite affordable.

# Sea bases defense

There is no front line at sea. All bases are equally vulnerable. The simplest choice is Naval yard and few guarrison units at every base plus small retaliating mobile fleet. This **is** expensive. The only bright side is that each enemy ship is about twice as costly as equivalent strength infantry defender. With Naval yard it makes your sea base defense four time more cost effective comparing to invasion fleet.
